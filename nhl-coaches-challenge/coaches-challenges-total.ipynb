    "# NHL Coaching Challenge - 2020-21 Season\n",
    "\n",
    "Nearing the end of the season during playoffs, one of the Tampa Bay's games against Montreal had a pretty early timeout `2021-07-03` the 196th timeout of the season was called by Montreal after falling down by 2 in the 1st period in game 3. The commentators started talking about how while rare, many teams end up losing a game and never even using their timeout at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "This stuck with me so I decided to find any potentially interesting fact about timeouts that I could for the 2020-21 season. I chose to stick to just a single season rather then multiple seasons as previously failed coaches challenges lead to a loss of a timeout and didn't want to mix the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "This code below is used to loop over the game event json files, find any timeouts, excluding TV-timeouts and do some basic data cleaning like adding time (in seconds) which team called timeout, who was winning at the time, by how much, etc.\n",
