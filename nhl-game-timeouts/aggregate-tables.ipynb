    "# NHL Team Timeouts - 2020-21 Season\n",
    "\n",
    "Nearing the end of the season during playoffs, one of the Tampa Bay's games against Montreal had a pretty early timeout `2021-07-03` the 196th timeout of the season was called by Montreal after falling down by 2 in the 1st period in game 3. The commentators started talking about how while rare, many teams end up losing a game and never even using their timeout at all. \n",
    "\n",
    "This stuck with me so I decided to find any potentially interesting fact about timeouts that I could for the 2020-21 season. I chose to stick to just a single season rather then multiple seasons as previously failed coaches challenges lead to a loss of a timeout and didn't want to mix the data.\n",
    " \n",
    "This code below is used to get the `team totals` and the `weekly timeouts`. The weekly timeouts is used to see if the overall percent of timeouts being used increased later into the season (playoffs) and groups games and timeouts by [ISO-8601 Week Number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601). The team totals simply adds up the total games played by each team and how often they called a timeout.\n",
